✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/node?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `pnpm nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
pnpm nx serve api
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
pnpm nx build api
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
pnpm nx show project api
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Python compute service

`apps/compute` is the Python 3.13 runtime for specialised processing workloads.
It uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for its project environment and
dependencies; it is an Nx application, not a pnpm workspace package.

Install its locked Python dependencies from the repository root:

```sh
uv sync --project apps/compute --frozen
```

Run the local service through Nx:

```sh
pnpm nx run compute:dev
```

The service listens at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and currently exposes only
`GET /health` and `GET /ready`.

Run its verification targets with:

```sh
pnpm nx run compute:lint
pnpm nx run compute:typecheck
pnpm nx run compute:test
pnpm nx run compute:build
```

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
pnpm nx g @nx/node:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
pnpm nx g @nx/node:lib mylib
```

You can use `pnpm nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `pnpm nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
pnpm nx g ci-workflow
```

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
